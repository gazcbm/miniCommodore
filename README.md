This is a miniature Commodore PET model equipped with an esp8266 board and a 64x128 oled display

It can open a wifi access point and connect to a wifi network and display stuff.
What it does depends on what you flash in it.

Prototype features a temperature/pressure/humidity sensor.

Roadmap:

Make more room in the base and body, try to power it using a small lipo battery (and power switch), set microswitches under the keyboards bound to ESP inputs to control program features...

And make a few games available.

Its first use is to host the iotinator master module (https://github.com/reivaxy/iotinator)
